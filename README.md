## Practicing Object-Oriented Programming

Note:
- Encapsulation: Restrict direct access to some of our attributes
- Abstraction: Only show the necessary attributes and hide the unnecessary information
- Polymorphism: Refers to many forms, poly = many, morphism = forms. Use a single type entity to represent different types in different scenarios. E.g: The built-in function `len`
